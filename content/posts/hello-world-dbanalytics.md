At the end of next week, I will leave my full-time job as BI Lead at Growth Street. I'm incredibly excited to announce that I'll be making the move into freelance consulting.

I'm writing this quick post to talk a bit about why I'm making the move, as much for my own benefit as that of the three other people who will read this blog (hi mum ðŸ‘‹).

## Why Now

The analytics toolkit available to early-stage high-growth businesses has completely changed over the past five years. Five years ago, building out an analytics function was an expensive and difficult undertaking. [It required a fair bit of data engineering](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/does-my-startup-data-team-need-a-data-engineer-b6f4d68d7da9). It required building a lot of things from the ground up, well before you saw any value from it.

Five years on, that has completely changed. The advent of tools like Stitch, Fivetran, dbt, and Snowflake means you can now get up and running very quickly and incredibly cost-effectively. Moreover, you'll have built something that is equipped to scale as your business does. I've spent the last few years [setting up these data stacks in-house for a handful of VC-backed businesses](https://www.growthstreet.co.uk/blog/product/growth-street-bi-stack). I firmly believe that the most successful businesses are those that make a continued investment into analytics, treating data as a first-class citizen from day one. 

My plan is to work with early-stage businesses, helping them start or scale their use of analytics. I believe businesses have a need to start building analytics capabilities before they can afford, or need, someone full-time who has the ability to do it all well. I hope to work with those businesses to put the right building blocks in place and help them get value from all the data that is at their disposal.

## Moving to Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ 

A huge factor in my decision is also the fact that I'll be moving to Canada this summer. I moved to the UK from Montreal when I was 13 and am excited to be moving back for a few years. I'll be based in Toronto from later this year.

With the move came a desire for increased flexibility. Freelancing ticked a lot of those boxes, allowing me to take a lot of my remote work with me and giving me the time to do a bit of travelling around North and South America from our base in Toronto.

## Starting a Business

I love startups. I've spent most of my career in early-stage businesses. I even started a small publishing business in 2015 (long story, longer year).

I fully intend to work in a freelance capacity for the foreseeable future. I have a lot to learn when it comes to consulting, having been exclusively in-house to-date. That said, I'm excited about having the option of scaling my work further by starting a small consultancy. I don't think it is on the cards any time soon. Even I probably don't have the ego to think that I could start something like that right away (my girlfriend, family and friends may disagree), but my desire to eventually run my own business has definitely factored in my decision.
