At the end of next week, I will leave my full-time job as BI Lead at Growth Street. I'm incredibly excited to announce that I'll be making the move into freelance consulting.

I'm writing this post to talk a bit about why I'm making the move, as much for my own benefit as that of the three other people who will read this blog (hi mum ðŸ‘‹).

The analytics toolkit available to early-stage high-growth businesses has completely changed over the past five years.

[It required a fair bit of data engineering](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/does-my-startup-data-team-need-a-data-engineer-b6f4d68d7da9). It required building a lot of things from the ground up, well before you saw any value from it.

Five years on, that has completely changed. The advent of tools like Stitch, Fivetran, dbt, and Snowflake means you can now get up and running very quickly. Moreover, you'll have built something that is equipped to scale as your business does. I've spent the last few years [setting up these data stacks in-house for a handful of VC-backed businesses](https://www.growthstreet.co.uk/blog/product/growth-street-bi-stack). 

My intention is to help businesses get more value from their data. I particularly want to ensure that businesses make the right decisions early on, making sure they put in place the right building blocks to scale their analytics use. My desire is to work with a number of businesses on an ongoing basis, before they have a need for a full-time analytics hire,
