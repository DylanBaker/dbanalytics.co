title: "Standing Offer"
---
Once upon a time, a fellow data enthusiast, [Simon Ouderkirk](https://s12k.com/standing-offer/), copied an idea of [Patrick McKenzie's](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) and now I'm copying Simon (copying Patrick).

So, much as they do, if anyone is going to be anywhere near where I live, where I work or where I might be at some point and wants to talk about technology and startups, particularly data and analytics, I'd love to buy you a coffee and have a chat.

I live in London, England. I'm moving to Toronto, Canada. I'm in Bristol visiting my parents a lot. I attend conferences from time to time. If you want to chat, hit me up. [I'm on Twitter a lot](https://twitter.com/DylanBakerCFM). You can also drop me an email on [my contact page](/contact).
