## Data Warehousing and ETL

You need your data in one place. I help businesses set up robust, scalable data pipelines. 

I can help choose and set up a data warehouse; I recommend Snowflake or BigQuery. I can also set up the ETL pipelines to get your data into your warehouse in a timely manner. Most of the time. this involves using third-party tools, but I can also help when you need something a bit more specific to your use-case.

## Data Modelling

Modelling your data is a key step in your data stack. Transformation unlocks the true value of your data.

Using tools like dbt, we'll transform your raw data from all your software and tools into production-ready data sets ready for analytics. We will also make sure that everyone in-house who needs to be trained up can contribute to the data models.
